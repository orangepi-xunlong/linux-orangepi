	  In a lot of cases there also need to be default settings initialized
	  to make some of them conform to expectations of the kernel.

	  In order to meet high performance and low power requirements, a power
	  management unit is designed or saving power when RK3288 in low power
	  mode. The RK3288 PMU is dedicated for managing the power of the whole chip.

	  Describe the hierarchy for the Dynamic Thermal Power Management tree
	  on this platform. That will create all the power capping capable
	  devices.
