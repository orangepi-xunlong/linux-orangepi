menuconfig PM_DEVFREQ
	bool "Generic Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) support"
	help
	  A device may have a list of frequencies and voltages available.
	  devfreq, a generic DVFS framework can be registered for a device
	  in order to let the governor provided to devfreq choose an
	  operating frequency based on the device driver's policy.

	  Each device may have its own governor and policy. Devfreq can
	  reevaluate the device state periodically and/or based on the
	  notification to "nb", a notifier block, of devfreq.

	  Like some CPUs with CPUfreq, a device may have multiple clocks.
	  However, because the clock frequencies of a single device are
	  determined by the single device's state, an instance of devfreq
	  is attached to a single device and returns a "representative"
	  clock frequency of the device, which is also attached
	  to a device by 1-to-1. The device registering devfreq takes the
	  responsiblity to "interpret" the representative frequency and
	  to set its every clock accordingly with the "target" callback
	  given to devfreq.

	  When OPP is used with the devfreq device, it is recommended to
	  register devfreq's nb to the OPP's notifier head.  If OPP is
	  used with the devfreq device, you may use OPP helper
	  functions defined in devfreq.h.

comment "DEVFREQ Governors"

config DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	bool "Simple Ondemand"
	help
	  Chooses frequency based on the recent load on the device. Works
	  similar as ONDEMAND governor of CPUFREQ does. A device with
	  Simple-Ondemand should be able to provide busy/total counter
	  values that imply the usage rate. A device may provide tuned
	  values to the governor with data field at devfreq_add_device().

config DEVFREQ_GOV_PERFORMANCE
	bool "Performance"
	help
	  Sets the frequency at the maximum available frequency.
	  This governor always returns UINT_MAX as frequency so that
	  the DEVFREQ framework returns the highest frequency available
	  at any time.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_POWERSAVE
	bool "Powersave"
	help
	  Sets the frequency at the minimum available frequency.
	  This governor always returns 0 as frequency so that
	  the DEVFREQ framework returns the lowest frequency available
	  at any time.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_USERSPACE
	bool "Userspace"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	help
	  Sets the frequency at the user specified one.
	  This governor returns the user configured frequency if there
	  has been an input to /sys/devices/.../power/devfreq_set_freq.
	  Otherwise, the governor does not change the frequnecy
	  given at the initialization.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_VANS
	depends on ARCH_SUN8IW3P1 && EVB_PLATFORM
	bool "Vans"
	help
	  Sets the frequency at the minimum available frequency when earlysuspend.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_DSM
	depends on EVB_PLATFORM
	depends on ARCH_SUN9IW1P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW5P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW6P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW8P1
	bool "Dsm"
	help
	  Sets the frequency according to dram scene management(DSM).

config ARM_EXYNOS4_BUS_DEVFREQ
	bool "ARM Exynos4210/4212/4412 Memory Bus DEVFREQ Driver"
	depends on CPU_EXYNOS4210 || CPU_EXYNOS4212 || CPU_EXYNOS4412
	select ARCH_HAS_OPP
	select DEVFREQ_GOV_SIMPLE_ONDEMAND
	help
	  This adds the DEVFREQ driver for Exynos4210 memory bus (vdd_int)
	  and Exynos4212/4412 memory interface and bus (vdd_mif + vdd_int).
	  It reads PPMU counters of memory controllers and adjusts
	  the operating frequencies and voltages with OPP support.
	  To operate with optimal voltages, ASV support is required
	  (CONFIG_EXYNOS_ASV).

config DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	bool "DRAM Frequency scaling"
	depends on DEVFREQ_GOV_USERSPACE || DEVFREQ_GOV_VANS || DEVFREQ_GOV_DSM
	help
	  DRAM Frequency scaling allows you to change the clock speed of
	  DRAM on the fly. This is a nice method to save power, because
	  the lower the DRAM clock speed, the less power the DRAM consumes.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ_CFS_SW
	bool "Change dram frequency in CFS mode, need extra software operation"
	depends on DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	depends on ARCH_SUN8IW6P1
	help
	  This will need extra software operation after changing dram frequency in CFS mode.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ_LOW_POWER_SW
	bool "Change dram frequency in software mode when low-power music playing"
	depends on DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	depends on ARCH_SUN8IW5P1
	help
	  This will use software mode to change dram frequency when low-power music playing.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ_BUSFREQ
	bool "Change bus frequency with dram frequency changed when low-power music playing"
	depends on DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	depends on ARCH_SUN9IW1P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW5P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW6P1
	help
	  This will allow bus frequency changed when low-power music playing.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ_VDDSYS
	bool "Change vdd-sys with dram frequency changed when low-power music playing"
	depends on DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	depends on ARCH_SUN9IW1P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW5P1
	help
	  This will allow vdd-sys changed when low-power music playing.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	bool "Change dram frequency in display vsync"
	depends on DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	depends on ARCH_SUN9IW1P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW5P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW6P1 || ARCH_SUN8IW8P1

	  This will allow dram frequency changed in display vsync.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DRAM_FREQ_DVFS
	bool "Dram work voltage change with frequency"
	depends on AW_AXP && DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ && ARCH_SUN8IW3P1
	help
	  This will allow dram work voltage dynamic changed when the frequency is changed.

	  If in doubt, say N.

config DRAM_FREQ_BSP_TEST
	bool "Dramfreq driver bsp test"
	depends on DEVFREQ_GOV_USERSPACE && DEVFREQ_DRAM_FREQ
	help
	  This will allow dramfreq driver for bsp test.

	  If in doubt, say N.
