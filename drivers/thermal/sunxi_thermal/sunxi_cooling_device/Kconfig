config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling"
	depends on ARCH_SUNXI
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	depends on !CPU_THERMAL
	help
	  Adds sunxi cpu budget cooling devices, and these cooling devices can be
	  bound to thermal zone trip points. When a trip point reached, the
	  bound cpufreq cooling device turns active to set CPU frequency low to
	  cool down the CPU.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_CPU_DVFS
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling about CPU-DVFS"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	help
	  Adds CPU cooling device about CPU dynamic-voltage-frequence-scaling.

config SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING_HOTPLUG
	tristate "sunxi budget cooling about Hotplug"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	depends on HOTPLUG_CPU
	depends on SUNXI_BUDGET_COOLING
	help
	  Adds CPU cooling device use hotplug limit.

config SUNXI_GPU_COOLING
	tristate "sunxi gpu cooling"
	depends on THERMAL_OF
	help
	  Adds sunxi gpu cooling devices, and these cooling devices can be
	  bound to thermal zone trip points. When a trip point reached, the
	  gpu cooling device turns active to set gpu frequency low to
	  cool down the CPU.
